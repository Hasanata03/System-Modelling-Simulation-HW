# System-Modelling-Simulation-HW
Bottle Crusher System - Modeling &amp; Simulation

This repository contains my coursework for the **KON301E System Modeling and Simulation** course. The project involves the mathematical modeling and simulation of a hydraulic bottle crusher system driven by a DC motor.

## 📄 Project Overview
The main objective of this assignment was to design a control system for a conveyor belt mechanism that compresses plastic bottles. The project includes:
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Deriving the transfer functions for the electromechanical and hydraulic subsystems.
* **Simulink Implementation:** Block diagram representation of the system.
* **Simscape Implementation:** Physical modeling using Simscape components.
* **Simulation & Analysis:** Comparing the step responses of both models.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**Grade Received: 81/100**

Please note that this project represents my personal approach to the assignment and reflects my own interpretation of the system parameters. While the simulation runs and produces logical results, certain modeling assumptions or parameter values may be open to discussion or further optimization.

**This code is intended for educational reference only and should not be considered a definitive or error-free solution.**

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Open MATLAB.
2.  Run the `parameters.m` script first to load the system variables into the workspace.
3.  Open and run `HW1_b.slx` (Simulink model) or `HW1_c.slx` (Simscape model).
